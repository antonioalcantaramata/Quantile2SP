# Quantile2SP

This repository includes examples for the implementation of "A Quantile Neural Network Framework for Two-stage Stochastic Optimization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11707)

## Content

- NN_training.py: uses the utils file to train a Quantile Neural Network with and without an Incremental output layer.
- QNN_embedding.py: example of the representation of the QNN as a mixed-integer set of constraints.
- IQNN_embedding.py: example of the representation of the QNN with Incremental output layer as a mixed-integer set of constraints.
